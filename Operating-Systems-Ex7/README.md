how to run and test out code:

make- will compile and execute all files
then will run test_fs and test_mylib

*You only have to write "make" in your terminal from the project directory!*
 
With the "cat" command you can read the file fs_data- which is our file system!

remarks:
We did twice those methods:
    myscanf, myscanf2
    myprintf, myprintf2
The reason is because our methods(2) do not match to the real signatures(from man pages)
so myscanf and myprintf will not work *but* myscanf2 and myprintf2 works !
